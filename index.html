        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          My first trip to India was more than a vacation—it was a sensory awakening. From the smoky tandoors of Punjab to the coconut-laced curries of Kerala, I was captivated by the diversity of spices and regional cuisines that told stories deeper than any guidebook could. That initial spark led to eight more immersive journeys across the country, each one driven by a desire to understand the nuances of flavor, technique, and tradition. I was not just tasting—I was studying. My goal was to find the most precise, respectful way to bring these culinary experiences back to the United States, not as watered-down imitations, but as vibrant tributes to the cultures that shaped them.

      <h3>How It All Began</h3>
      <p>
        It started with a plane ticket and a craving—not just for food, but for something deeper.
        What was meant to be a short escape turned into six months of immersive living, cooking,
        and learning alongside locals who didn’t just feed me—they welcomed me into their kitchens,
        their stories, and their rhythms...
        <br><br>
        When I finally returned home, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this experience shouldn’t be
        reserved for the lucky few who get to travel. I wanted to bottle that essence—the warmth,
        the creativity, the soul of those shared meals—and bring it to anyone who’s ever wished they
        could taste the world without leaving their kitchen.
